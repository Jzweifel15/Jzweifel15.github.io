The second module of the Part-time Online Software Engineering Cohort for Flatiron Schools was primarily about creating and setting up databases for web-applications that use an MVC (Model, View, Controller) layout, using RESTful naming patterns to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) actions on those databases, and sending HTTP requests to a local server to display a View that shows the user certain data from the database based on those requests. In this module I have learned so much about creating relationships amongst different Models and setting up associations for those models to a database. One of the most important things that I learned during this module was how to use the Sinatra Gem. Sinatra, in Ruby, is a library that allows any programmer [that knows how to properly use the gem] to build a somewhat smaller MVC web-application. Even though Sinatra was learned more towards the end of this module, everything before it was important to understand in order to successfully comprehend how to properly use Sinatra. 

Now, that we're in project week for our second portfolio project it was time to show off what I had learned from this module. We had to create a web-application (using Sinatra of course) that utilizes an MVC layout, has more than one model that can be created/associated to a database, uses the RESTful naming patterns for routes to transition from view-to-view, and successfully perform CRUD actions on a database. For my project, I decided to create a small music playlist creator. This application will allow anyone to sign up (or, sign in if you already have an account) and create your own playlist filled with the music you love. A user can create as many playlists as they want with however many songs they want to add and can name their playlist whatever they want. If they want to add a song to an existing playlist, they can edit/update an already existing playlist, or if the user just does not want the playlist on their homescreen anymore, they can simply delete/destroy the playlist from existence. 

Of course with any project, one of the hardest parts is actually figuring out where to start. For anyone wanting to create a Sinatra application, there is actually this really nice, extremely helpful and time-saving gem called 'Corneal' that I highly recommend any Rubyist downloads locally to their computer. The Corneal gem actually sets up everything you'll need to get started building your Sinatra application right away without any headaches. All you'll need to type into your terminal
(after installing the gem of course) is "corneal new [APP-NAME]" where "[APP-NAME]" is the whatever you want to name your project. After you type all that in, you'll see a bunch of files and folders automatically created for you. Just open the new directory in your favorite code editor and get started. 

Like I said, I learned a lot from this module, however, I definitely learned the most by actually trying to build my own project. I ran into all sorts of problems (as any software engineer does when working on any project), but being able to troubleshoot these errors/bugs within my own code allowed me to really think/brainstorm logical soultions that would eventually lead to the problem being solved.

Overall, I'm very proud of my code and my complete project. I spent a lot of time working on it the past two-weeks and I can't wait to move on to the next module of the cohort (assuming my project review goes well).
