Hello everybody,

I decided to learn software development because it has always been a dream of mine to get into some type of technical field where I can help people. In the realm of computer science, there are many paths that can be taken when learning how to program. Software development is not the only career path that I plan to look into upon going through my cohort, but becoming a software engineer is definitely a big one. Especially, how high the deman is for SEs. I'm hoping that one day, with the knowledge that I obtain, I can one day give back to those who are wanting to do the same thing.
