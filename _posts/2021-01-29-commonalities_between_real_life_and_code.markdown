Hello everybody,

Since going through the cohort and learning how to properly code, all I now see is code. I continuously point out little aspects and events in my life by saying in my head how it can be coded. For example, if im hungry, I'll say something nerdy like, "if hungry -> go get food; else if smelly -> take shower; else -> do nothing". Not sure if i'm the only one doing this, but ever since I started working with code and on smaller projects, I definitely think in code, probably more than I should, but i'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is a good thing since we're all aspiring software engineers in the making.
