As the Rails module is gradually coming to end, now is the time to start thinking about the final project. When it came to this module, it wasn't much different from the previous module when we were studying up on the Sinatra framework. There were much similarities between Sinatra and Rails, which made learning Rails all that much more simple. However, with Rails being a much bigger framework than Sinatra, of cource Rails would have its own way of doing things. 

When it came down to the final project for the Rails module, some of the requirements were very similar, but not identical to the Sinatra final project, except for the fact that the project had to be built using the Rails framework. The set up process for the project was quick, easy, and similar to Sinatra; just setting up the  models and their associations, along with the migration files for setting up the database. Then, came the part where Rails differs from Sinatra; although both 
frameworks are built around the MVC architecture, Rails, of course, does things differently than Sinatra. After the models came setting up the controllers and linking each controller action with the corresponding route. Sinatra does not use routes like Rails does. Next, came setting up the views files using partials for setting up forms that could be used across different pages. Once I got the basic backbone of the project came my favorite part: setting up sessions and authentications for the different types of users. 

The idea of my Rails project is that there are two types of users: a student or a professor, so upon initially accessing the website, the user will be prompted to sign in as a student or to sign in as a professor. If the user is signing in as a student, then they will see a student login form, but if the user is a professor, then that user will see a professor sign in form. Basically, the two different users will see a similar login form, however, the idea is that upon signing in, a student has less admin credentials when being compared to a professor. 

Overall, if you didn't struggle and had fun with Sinatra, then you'll definitely love Rails and it'll be a breeze. So far, it has been my favorite module of the cohort and I can't wait to see what the rest of the program has to offer with JavaScript being the next module.
